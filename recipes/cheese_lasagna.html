        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>48 ounce jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>30 ounce ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons parsley, dried or finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups grated mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles, do not need to be "no bake", regular are fine</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly grease a 13x9 inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine ricotta cheese, eggs, parmesan cheese, parsley and one cup of mozzarella cheese.  Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>To assemble lasagna, place 1 and 1/2 cups of spaghetti sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Gently place four lasagna noodles onto sauce. Most 13×9 inch pans will fit three noodles length (13" side) wise, and a shorter, broken noodle width (9" side) wise.</li>
            <li>Add approximately 1/3 of the cheese mixture to the top of the noodles, and gently spread across noodles. Top cheese with 1 cup of sauce, then noodles, then cheese again. Repeat one more time, finishing with a final layer of sauce. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to stand for ten minutes prior to serving.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
